I've completed Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) and Master of Business Studies (MBS) from National University in 2010 & 2011 respectively. My major Subject was Accounting. But I've a big fantasy on Computer Technology. Basically I love it to do anything on computer. That's why I was searching for something to learn. If that learn can bring me some money, That will be fine for me and my family as well. For this reason I got admitted myself in this Shopify Course. My mentor Name is Farid Rony Bhai. I think he is a nice guy, I didn't talk with him personally. But his way of teaching and talking with the students attact me. I wish If I could speech like him. Thanks </p>
